### Contents
The optimal solution can be calculated with high-precision (see [TP3_ClosedFormEquations](TP3_ClosedFormEquations.m)).
The control-only, inner-loop solution (i.e., the optimal control for any given k) can be solved using a linear program created with a direct transcription method (see [TP3_Inner](TP3_Inner.m)).
In addition, the code is available to replicate the results from the papers below.
