# Test Problem 2: Co-Design Transfer

### Formulation
![formulation](media/formulation.svg)

---
### Contents
The control-only, inner-loop solution is available (i.e., the optimal control is known for any given k).
The objective function (as a function of k) is known but many local minimums can be present (see references below).
See [TP2_ClosedFormEquations](TP2_ClosedFormEquations.m) for the closed-form equations.
In addition, the code is available to replicate the results from the papers below.
