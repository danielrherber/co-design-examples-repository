# Test Problem 2: Co-Design Transfer

### Formulation

---
### Contents
The control-only, inner-loop solution is available (i.e., the optimal control is known for any given k). The objective function (as a function of k) is known but many local minimums can be present (see references below). See [TP2_ClosedFormEquations](TP2_ClosedFormEquations.m) for the closed-form equations. The codes to replicate the results in two DETC papers below are also available.
